# speech-to-text-transcription
Developed a robust speech-to-text transcription system capable of accurately converting spoken language into written text, even in noisy environments. Leveraged OpenAI Whisper and transformers-based models for transcription, and integrated audio preprocessing techniques using librosa and noisereduce to enhance clarity and reduce background noise. Employed torchaudio for audio handling and Kaggle datasets for training and evaluation. The system demonstrates effective noise handling and high transcription accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications like voice assistants, automated captioning, and accessibility tools.
